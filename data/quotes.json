        "content": "Силвербане` — Today at 5:05 AM\nits likely we're heading toward a global nuclear (and what else they have) conflict and im not even kidding. Each side has backed itself into a corner where it is impossible to back off from this ukrainian conflict without complete humiliation\n\nrussia framed it as a revenge war against western expansionism, and most russians believe it (which i think its fair enough, given the mistakes of the West after USSR collapse towards russia)\n\nthey are now all in, with mobilisation. No leader can back off without being completly fucked politically\n\nMost nationalists would rather try to find someone even more hawkish. And russia cannot afford to lose crimeea. its inconcievable. Yet ukraine is winning conventionally, up till now anyways. So backed into a corner. Only option is escalation\n\nWhile US & West have also backed themselves into a corner politically, because they framed from beggning this war as a global struggle between autocracy and democracy. Your guys even publicly said that if ukraine loses, then virtually every dictator would move to invade to settle scores, thus \" rules based order\" led by US would collapse. It doesnt even mean its true, but saying it is actually backing yourself into a corner, because it might actually goad other dictators to do it. So now US cant back off from this conflict without losing face. No way out. And even holding still doesnt work, because with the weapons provided already so far ukraine is winning. So staying still leads to escalation nevertheless\n\nThe constant news feed of ukraine horror has made it impossible for any EU politician to abandon military support to ukraine, because it would be politically suicidal. If he does it he would be called a russian puppet. So nobody can do it even if they want (see Giorgia Meloni who won in italy, even if it was initially friendly to putin, they cant now because of public backlash. So they promised weapons)\nEach side has turned this regional conflict into a global struggle\n\nno one can back off without being completly ruined\npolitically and their soft power\n\nAnd US made a HUGE DANGEROUS GAMBLE in believing putin would be overthrown by russians. Massive miscalculations. You guys goaded russia into invading by not making even the slightest concessions at the negotiations before the war. Knowning they cant win conventionally against the entire military industry of the west that its now arming ukraine. But this gamble is massive, because if putin is not overthrown (and even if he does, its most likely to be replaced by someone even more hawkish against west), russia is not breaking apart, its escalating.\n\nUnless someone magically accepts the humiliation of backing off from this, which is extremly unlikely, i cant honestly see a way out of it. Its an escalation spiral\n\nAlso the growing support behind the idea of US striking russia conventionally if they use nukes in ukraine shows how badly cornered everyone is in this situation. No russian leader or even people is going to accept a direct US strike on them or their forces. Doing so would be political suicide in this environment. So they will respond to US attacks to them. And the response will be likely 99% nuclear, if they already used some nuke in ukraine. Even if US strikes conventionally. Because they dont have much conventional strike back capability at that point anyways\n\nNot your guys, i meant US. was talking to some US boy and thought i would share my view with u"
